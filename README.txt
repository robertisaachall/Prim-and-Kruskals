To run the game open the command prompt to the directory where the files for the game are stored. 
Use the command "build 'enter letter of your drive here' 'cities_name_file.txt' city_mileage_file.txt' ". I have included two sets of test files for you to use. To use you will type in "build c cities.txt city_mileage.txt".

General Usage Information

This is the final program of my Design of Algorithms class. I had the choice between using C++ or Java. As I was taking Object-Oriented Programming at the same time I opted for Java to hone my skillset.
The program uses cities: names, and mileages to calculate Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm.
